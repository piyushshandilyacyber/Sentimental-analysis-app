# SentiMind - Sentiment Analysis Tool

This is a sentiment analysis application that uses machine learning to analyze the sentiment of text input. The application is built with React and TypeScript, with a clean, intuitive UI.

## Features

- Text input for sentiment analysis
- Real-time sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral)
- Visualization of sentiment scores and confidence metrics
- Analysis history to track previous submissions
- Detailed breakdown of sentiment factors
- Mobile-responsive design

## Technical Implementation Notes

This project is currently using a simulated machine learning backend. In a production environment, this would be replaced with:

1. A Python backend using libraries like:
   - NLTK
   - TextBlob
   - spaCy
   - Scikit-learn
   - PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning models

2. An API to connect the React frontend with the Python ML backend (e.g., Flask, FastAPI)

## Future Improvements

- Implementation of a real Python ML backend
- More advanced sentiment analysis algorithms
- Entity recognition to identify subjects of sentiment
- Comparative analysis between different texts
- Batch processing for multiple texts
- Export functionality for analysis results

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
